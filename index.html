    <h1> The idea behind the MarbleDesignSystem </h1>

    <p>
        <b>
            Diagrams have the unique ability to express complex things simply.
            <br>
            Never had reactive programming been made so visual.
            <br>
            Diagrams is transforming information into compelling images
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Marble diagrams serve a <b>method for </b>
        us to visualize processes over time.
        This helps programmers and engineers to understand and design reactive
        processes.

        The overall goal of the MarbleDesignSystem is to provide a unified way of
        reading and creating stream based
        diagrams,
        in particular one specific type of it, the marble diagrams.

        This guide explains all building blocks of the design system step by step and
        in detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        In general we have some main rules that system follows:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Consistent
        </li>
        <li>
            Intuitive
        </li>
        <li>
            Easy
        </li>
        <li>
            Detailed
        </li>
        <li>
            Customizable
        </li>
    </ul>


</div>


<div class="slide" id="slide4">
    <h2>Consistency</h2>

    <p>
        There are several things to follow if you try to create a standard.
        One of them is more <b>critical for a positive outcome </b>
        than everything else, <b>consistency</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        By working with a <b>standardized, reproducible approach </b>
        we managed to create <b> a consistent way </b> of drawing marble diagrams.
        <b> A set of rules </b> developed over many many iterations, adopted and
        simplified to serve as a guideline and blueprint for <b> creating and
        using </b>
        these diagrams.
    </p>

    <h2>Intuitive</h2>

    <p>
        As programming with Rx is hard we made sure to keep it intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>

        By <b> including </b>a lot of <b>people</b> into the process of the creation
        of this guide we collected a lot of <b>personal feedback</b> to improve the
        system.

    </p>

    <p>

        To make sure we consider <b> a common way</b> interpretation we created
        several <b>public polls</b>
        we were collected and evaluated the general understanding.
        This helped us to make our system <b>intuitive to understand</b>.

    </p>


</div>
<div class="slide" id="slide44">
    <h2>
        Easy
    </h2>

    <p>

        As mindset behind the system are several principles.
        One of them is <b>“Easy to adopt and create”</b>, which means we want to
        provide <b>a way for everybody</b> to
        <b>read and create</b> marble diagrams.

    </p>

    <p>
        To achieve this we create all diagrams in either googleSlides oder Powerpoint.
        We believe this two options <b> enable</b> a big group of <b>people</b> to <b>edit
        and draw </b> these diagrams.
    </p>

    <h2>
        Detailed
    </h2>


    <p>
        Marble diagrams exist since a long time now.
        As there was no well thought standard out there and not all edge cases
        considered,
        people started to create their own solutions to visualize processes.
        These let to a variety of different ways of drawing these diagrams.
        Some of the better approaches were able to visualize more complex prozesses,
        but there is one essential thing which nobody considered yet,
        but which is most critical to understand processes based on Rx. The internal
        behavior of operators.

    </p>

    <p>
        This system is not only providing a consistent, standardized way of drawing
        marble diagrams,
        but also offers a way to visualize the internals of operators.
        Of course based on the systems rules it selfe.

        The design guide doesn’t limit the choice of font.

        Only a few limitations are suggested.

        Serif font-face and mono-space letter.

        Serif Font-Face
        Serif font-face has compared to the serif font-faces less visual noise.

        Mono-space
        Mono-space font has to be used in the description of observables, operators or in the text of notifications.
        This ensures that the with of text is directly proportional to the number of characters and therefore simplifies
        the positioning and alignment of text in diagrams.
